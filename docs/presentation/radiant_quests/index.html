            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Radiant quests (a term popularized by Bethesda games like Skyrim) are procedurally generated, repeatable missions that provide variety 
                and replayability to a game. Unlike static quests with fixed objectives, radiant quests dynamically select from a pool of 
                possible locations, objectives, and rewards to create unique experiences each time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this tutorial, we'll build a complete radiant quest system for our Pythonic MUD, centered around a Boardwalk area 
                with mini-games and randomized fetch quests. We'll cover everything from designing the data structures to implementing 
                the gameplay mechanics, and we'll explore how these systems can be extended for more complex gameplay.
            </p>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Working Evennia MUD installation (version 0.9.5+)</li>
                <li>Basic understanding of Python and object-oriented programming</li>
                <li>Familiarity with MUD concepts and Evennia's architecture</li>
                <li>The character attributes system we implemented in the previous sprint</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="note">
                <strong>Note:</strong> All code in this tutorial is designed to integrate with the Pythonic MUD project 
                structure. If you're using a different setup, you may need to adapt the import statements and class 
                inheritance patterns.
