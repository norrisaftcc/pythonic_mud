            <h3>Maze Generation Algorithms</h3>
            <p>
                For our Boardwalk maze, we'll implement a random maze generator that creates new layouts each time. We'll use 
                the depth-first search algorithm with backtracking, a popular approach for generating perfect mazes (mazes with no loops).
            </p>

                <strong>Note:</strong> For simplicity in our MUD implementation, we'll represent the maze as a grid of connected rooms

                <strong>Tip:</strong> The MazeRoom typeclass includes perception checks based on the character's wisdom attribute to detect 
                hidden items. This integrates our maze system with the character attributes system we built previously.
